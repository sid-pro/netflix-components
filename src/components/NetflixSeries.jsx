// Vite automatically serves any static assets placed in the public folder at the root of your project.
// This folder is meant for static files that you want to be served as-is without processing by Viteâ€™s build system.
// Files inside the public folder are served at the root level of the base URL.
// For example, if you have an image located at public/images/stranger-thing.png,
//  it can be accessed via http://localhost:5173/images/stranger-thing.png when running the development server.
